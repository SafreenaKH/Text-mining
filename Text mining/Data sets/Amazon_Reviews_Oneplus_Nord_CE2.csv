0,4.0,Good phone-could have been better !,"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",19 December 2022
1,4.0,This is a branded budget phone üì±,"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",5 January 2023
2,4.0,A mildly perfect phone,"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",12 January 2023
3,4.0,Okay for the budget phone.,Operating system and multitasking is good for the budget phone. But it could be better if we have option to choose the time format of 12 hour instead of 24 hour since most of us are habituated with the 12 hour time. Its the 2nd day of usage and seems battery drains a bit faster than I thought (Maybe because I used samsung before that's why I feel it that way) else decent for the budget phone.,3 March 2023
4,4.0,Budget friendly reliable phone,"I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.",5 February 2023
5,4.0,Good phone if you buy under 18K,"Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy.

8,4.0,Never Settle,"Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience.

32,4.0,Going great...for now,"I received it today. The quality is good. It's apt for gamers or video watchers. It has an expandable 5gb internal RAM. You have to make changes in the basic settings for it to become less technical and more usage friendly, like keypad. Battery is not draining fast but charges fast. The adapter is gigantic and travelers would need extra space for it. Adjusting to the sim tray and external memory or sim option could prove challenging. Bluetooth sound with wireless Samsung neck band wasn't so great. Sound vibrates while taking a video call. You should lower it to avoid spoiling the speakers. Not comfortable to carry with you while doing a workout. The phone came with a transparent cover.",11 January 2023

¬†Build quality - Rating 7.5 : One of the light weight phones out there and has to say it's quite comfortable for one hand usage and even the material used is polycarbonate but gets the job done but doesn't matter if back cover is there . In terms of styling it's similar to oppo phone but i liked it but won't recommend gray one as it attaches fingerprints but if you are going to use back cover then it doesn't matterDisplay -  Rating 8 : Really good amoled plan and 90hz refresh rate works well wish it could have been 120hz . But the bottom chin is quite thick that is the only thing and yes there is gorilla glass 5 protection and screen guard pre applied too . But the panel on this one is the not the best out there but it's pretty decent as wellPerformance - Rating 9 :Dimensity 900 with ufs 2.2 and lppdr4x Ram gets the job done for regular day to day operations and I didn't played games so can't say but considering this soc is pretty good you can expect 50 fps stable in bgmi and cod . Still I would say this processor is good but competition is offering better so you decide . For me gaming doesn't matter and for next 2 years it can last me easily for normal.usageSoftware- 8.5 : biggest con is Android 11 based on oxygen OS or should I say future color oos üòÇ but overall it's quite stable and no bugs as of now but still can't say a lot will have to wait for Android 12 to have better ideaCamera -  Rating 7.5 : 64mp is decent I was atleast expecting samsung sensor though but they provided omnivison sensor which gets the job done but to be Frank I am not into camera that much so better to check other reviews and video stability in 1080p is good and 8mp ultratwide is decent as well . Still the camera is not the best out there again I am saying this because others are offering better but OnePlus managed to give decent thingsBattery -  Rating 9: on 90hz refresh rate with 40 percent brightness and dark mode excluding gaming it gives 7 hrs of sot from 99 to 89 on wifi network and then 89 to 59 on jio network and rest remaining on wifi . So battery for normal tasks can last more than 1.5 day . Charging takes about 30 minutes to charge from 10 percent to 99 which is pretty fastSpeakers -  6: pathetic only single speaker and quality is moderate5g bands - 8 bands so it' is futuristicCall quality - Rating 10 :  it's amazing pretty loud and none of the parties ever complained about my voice that is getting mumbledSo to conclude you can buy this one if you only care for OnePlus and you want to try OnePlus for the first time . I was even getting mi 11 lite ne 5g at same price but rejected it due to miui . So for normal users and those who want a stable software without any ads or notification or bloatwares its good",Reviewed in India üáÆüá≥ on 26 February 2022

161,5.0,It's worth the money,"Well, wherever I have looked at the review of this phone, I have came across a lot of bad mouthing for sure - especially in comparison to the phones from Realme or Xiaomi.What I felt the reason for that is, the 1+ branding. People are judging this phone based on the brand image of 1+ and the expectations are pretty high. But if you consider this one from the standpoint of pure pricing, I think you'll find yourself on some reasonable ground.Reasons for me to go with this one -1) Needed good RAM and internal memory.2) Pretty good Camera performance was needed. (Stock camera app is not great, so side loaded G cam & desired result has been achieved)3) Needed clean UI. Cannot tolerate advertising and bloatwares. (Biggest reason for me to not go for Xiaomi or Realme)4) Guaranteed 2 upcoming Android updates and security updates for 3 years.5) Very good battery, with ultra fast 33W charging.Not a gamer. So didn't care for that aspect.Occasion reading will be done on the phone. Good display in that aspect. 90Hz or 120Hz doesn't personally make a difference to me. So...Call quality (clear quality & no drops, good Bluetooth TWS connections) is good.I am such a user, who do not go in to the minute details when using a phone. A phone serves these above said purposes for me. I do not care if the fingerprint reader has a 0.1 micro second delay that some other brand!! So, this one ticks all the boxes.To make my POV clear, I am someone who do not find sense in spending huge amount of money on a 6 inch phone, which you will use for YouTube and Instagram. But at the same time I am someone who will favour paying good money on productive devices like an iPad or a MacBook depending on the utility of the same. It all boils down to what you want out of the device. Do not follow the crowd. Choose as per your UTILITY.",Reviewed in India üáÆüá≥ on 16 December 2022

266,3.0,Average Phone. So keep average expectations.,"Writing the reviews after 3 days of UsageDesign: Phone's design is good looking and decent. The phone sits well in the hands but has to be used with a cover due to its glossy finish at the back. The phone comes with a cover and the screen cover as well. There is one speaker besides the charging point and there's a 3.5mm jack as well. Volume buttons are to the left side and the front camera is placed at the top left corner of the phone.Performance: Good performance. I tried gaming on this phone with high specs and found no issues, no major lags found. Yeah the phone heats up a bit after continuous usage. Continuous calls will heat the phone as well. Heating issues reported on other OnePlus devices are still being noticed here in this phone but not to thay extent, seems that OnePlus has worked on it but not to a greater extent! Apps work smoothly as far as performance is concerned. Unlocking phone is quick. Android 12 could have made this phone a perfect buy, but that's not a deal breaker either as OnePlus has promised a guaranteed 2 year Phone updates and 3 years security updates.Battery: Okayish. If you're a gamer or heavy user like viewing lot of videos etc, you'll have to charge your phone twice a day. For a Average user this phone will get 1 day enough to survive. Battery drains are worked but again not to a great extent. But that is coped up with the 65W charger which as per my real time experiments charged from 0 to 80 in 25 mins not 15 mins claimed by OnePlus. Battey improvements must be done by OnePlus further.Camera: Decent, but not impressive. 64MP is what on the papers but realme sensors work good versus this Phone. Night photos are not sharp as well. Colors are thrown by the AI but still would like to have improvements on the camera perspective. Definitely not the OnePlus benchmark cams for sure.Music, Audio, Video, Display: The speakers are not dobly ones but do the job wonderfully. Enough sound and no issues with video calls. Watching videos and graphics are good, impressed here. Phone will give you two options of 60 hz and 90 hz display rates with 90 as default and this too does the job very well. Scrolling and switching between the apps works smooth.Overall its a decent phone. The issue stands with longetivity of the Mediatek Processor and OnePlus support to this phone. As per my views if you're a gamer, would suggest not to go with this phone. If you're a normal user and charging phone twice a day is not a concern for you, go for it. If you are user having expectations from camera performance, don't go with this phone. If you're a user who wants decent performance and camera, then go for this phone.Will update my reviews ad and when I keep using this phone and find anything.",Reviewed in India üáÆüá≥ on 28 February 2022

270,4.0,Best for elderly people,"Bought in big billion day sale but towards the end. My experience is when Amazon takes time in delivering a product, it will be worth it because they push bad product line in starting and immediate delivery. Gifted my mother (58years), and for an elderly person, this phone is perfect.I was initially confused whether to buy this then went for it after reading reviews that its good for elderly person.I setup the phone before giving to my mother. And I am using oneplus6t constantly since may 2019. So oneplus nord ce 2 lite felt like a power in hand.

I'm writing this review after using this phone for 7 months. Till now it's great. I'm giving 4 stars bcz I received a phone with scratch on it's border. Otherwise phone is good but it's not water and dust proof.",5 December 2022
303,5.0,A good choice for upgrade,"Nord CE 2 is a decent choice for someone looking to upgrade from an under 15k segment phone. Review after using the 6GB variant for 5 days:Pros:- Decent battery life and excellent charging speed- Smooth performance and display- Comparatively compact and light weight- ""Unofficial"" water resistance (read below)- Design and color is neatCons:- Speaker isn't great- Camera is okayish- Unsure of OS experience in the future, stable and bloat free as of nowDetailed:- Decent battery life and performance. I got around 7 to 8 hrs of screen time from battery at 100% to 20% with normal use with 4G internet (social media, chat, some camera and mobile hotspot tethering at 90HZ display refresh rate). Changing display refresh rate to 60Hz seems to improve battery drain, but 90Hz looks very smooth.- 65W fast charging is great, can charge from 20% to 100% in 30 minutes. Also not much heating during charging.- OS looks clean, some preinstalled apps could be uninstalled or disabled. But surprisingly found 3 file manager apps (of which two can be disabled) and two photos app (OnePlus Gallery and Google Photos app, which can't be uninstalled). Didn't find any bugs or functionality issue, no lags or stuttering. Apps open instantly and work fine. OxygenOS 11.3 with Feb 2022 security patch. I guess a stable Android 11 is better than a buggier Android 12 for most customers. But not sure what will happen from OxygenOS 12 which shares Oppo's ColorOS.- Some heating issue was there on a first day of use, but then got a system update and haven't noticed any heating afterwards.- Saw a rubber seal for the SIM tray, which could mean that there is some degree of water resistance, but there is no official IP rating. Also saw a YouTube video that tests the water resistance and the phone survived 15 min submersion in water. So there seems to be ""unofficial"" water resistance.- Cameras are okayish. Main cam takes good pictures at good lighting, but colors are a bit saturated. In wide angle camera, the exposure and color is less. Photos from selfie cam are a bit soft without any filters or modes. Haven't tested much low light or night photography.- Phone back panel is made of plastic, feels like plastic to touch but the blue color back panel looks really good. Good to hold in hand and use because of comparatively compact and thin size. A smaller bottom chin / bezel would have been better. The case provided is translucent and has a small pattern design (ie its not a plain).Overall it's a good phone to buy, you get some features like headphone jack and expandable memory which is good for people who have been using it from their previous phones.",27 February 2022

353,2.0,Android Auto Doesn't Work || UPI Apps don't work on Roaming,"Bought it 19 August. Regretting since 20 August.Took me a while to figure out how to start Android Auto by default when plugged into a car (you have to manually enable Android Auto the first time). First time I plugged it in I was in a busy road and was unsure which way to go. The phone just wouldn't pick up Android Auto. I had to manually configure it later on after watching a couple of videos on YT. Since then, whenever I plug it in my car, I keep getting the pop-up that asks me to choose whether I want to ""Use USB to - Charge Only - or Transfer Files/Android Auto - or Transfer Photos"". No matter how many times I select Android Auto, the same thing keeps popping up, and Android Auto DOES NOT WORK. Never faced this problem with my old Redmi Note 5 Pro.When I was roaming outside my home circle (Kolkata) for a few weeks, the following apps didn't work: Zomato, PhonePe, Paytm. I had read before ordering the phone that they don't always optimize apps for non-Snapdragon processors. With its Mediatek Dimensity 900 ""monster of a chipset"", my phone itself turned into a monster and betrayed me when I needed it most. I couldn't order food, and GPay was my only savior for payment through QR code scanning. Only at my room with a wifi, these apps worked. Then when I came back to Kolkata again these apps started working fine.When I drive 550km to my hometown, there are long stretches when there is no network, yet on my previous phone, Android Auto would continue to work as the car/phone was probably following its GPS. I could rely on it. Since purchasing this phone, I don't have the confidence any more that Android Auto will even work in an area with full network, let alone in an area without any.When connected for even 5 minutes on USB to car, the phone heats up. More than once it simply hung up and stopped functioning. The fingerprint sensor often is not able to read the fingerprint.There are pros - the 65W charging is super fast; and the camera is reasonably good (if it weren't on a 25k phone, that would be another star taken away).Overall, I am dissatisfied and disillusioned with the phone. Better to buy a top model Maruti Swift with all features abnd accessories than a lowest model Hyundai Creta with zero features and accessories. For the 25k price range, it's better to go for a Redmi phone with top specs than the lowest end OnePlus phones. I don't know about other OnePlus models but this one is a disaster.Severely disappointed.",Reviewed in India üáÆüá≥ on 8 November 2022

404,5.0,Mid ranger Flagship.,I got this mobile for ‚Çπ 16999 which was an awesome deal for me. I have rated this phone based on 5 rating points.Delivery- 5/5 was superfast and exchange took place with ease and got offer of extraa ‚Çπ3000 discount.Packaging- 5/5 Packaging was awesome by amazon and Oneplus packaging is clean and very good all the documents including Red Cable Membership card got 3 months extended warranty using this.Charging-5/5 65 watt charger is already provided in the box which phone supports very nice move not like other companies. Charging cable is of good quality and charger as well.Looks- 4.5/5 Aesthetic wise its premium with glass back and curved edges and metal frame. camera bump is not very much unusual and gives decent look to phone. Inbox provided cover is of very good quality and looks very good. It feels good to hold and not feel very bulky termed as slimmest oneplus phone. Lower chin is on big side could be a bit smaller.Connectivity-5/5 Total number of 5G band supported is 7 and the phone supports VOWIFI on both sim. It supports dual 5G which I feel is future proof. Bluetooth connectivity is awesome with earbuds. It also supports dual band wifi. Its has got triple slot.O.S-4/5 Only issues is that it runs on Android 11 out of the box but with latest android security update and future update promises. OS is very smooth no lags were found. Always on display is very good. Customization is top notch.Sensor-5/5 It has got all the sensors as required including step counter.Battery-5/5 Charging from 0-100 hardly takes time with in box charger. If AOD is on and little battery consumption is on higher side with 90hz screen. I feel its good with F-amoled display.Screen-5/5 Fell in love with it in display fingerprint scanner is very good and display is bright enough at this price point better than MI phones. Display is immersive. It supports HDR10+ and comes with corning gorilla glass 5.Camera-4/5 Back camera is good with natural light and though struggles in low light.Dark mode does a good job.4K video is supported at 30fps Selfie camera is good with lot of features. No OIS is provided in both the camera. But EIS present.Calling- Its very loud and clear and no issues found.Perfomance-5/5 taking pricing point into consideration its good mid ranger chipset works well with heavy games at medium setting and normal day to day operations are carried out without any lags.GB ram is enough for daily operation.My recommendation is that if you get this phone at ‚Çπ20K the its a very good deal without any single thought go for it. However if you are a gamer and want a phone below 20K then you can go for Infinix 5G. However If you want a good camera phone at same price point of this then go for Realme 9 PRO Plus without any thought as camera is excellent for still photos but you will have to compromise with display.,Reviewed in India üáÆüá≥ on 27 February 2022

¬†I am editing the review what I am facing in day to day task , using the phone since 5 months :Pros:1. Performance is superb, didn't feel any lag or bug yet.( ***Edition: YouTube unexpectedly closing 2-3 times repeatedly in 1 day , that may be bug which I faced recently)2. OS & Software: Got 3 security updates using since 5 months & 1 Android update ( Android 11 to 12 next day after purchasing the phone)3. Battery Charging : 40-45 min approx.4. Battery Drain: 1 day for moderate user ( WhatsApp, Insta, YouTube, Online Classes etc.)5. Gaming Performance: don't play any games so look some other's review.6. Camera: Superb in day light, descent in low light.7. Speaker: Single speaker is loud enough for your entertainment.8. Refresh Rate : for day to day task, 90 Hz r.r is smooth enough to perform.9. You can definitely enjoy 4K YouTube Videos (As HDR 10 Certified).10. Special Features: Pocket Mode (No accidental impression on screen when phone is in your pocket), Expernal Storage ( Most of brands neglect this), 3.5 mm jack.Cons:1. Accidental screenshot is captured due to Volume button. It should be placed on slightly upper portion. You may the face the problem whenever you lock the screen.(***Edition: You can turn off that features for screenshot in setting)2. Camera should be improved in low light.3. It must be upgraded upto Android 14.4. You can't record any call otherwise it will inform the person that you are recording the voice.Pro Tips: 1. Use ""Ultra Steady Mode"" to take video for your content/personal memory.2. Select 'Standard Refresh Rate' for better battery output.I will edit my review later if I face an issue regarding daily usage.",Reviewed in India üáÆüá≥ on 24 September 2022

The Nord CE 2 also offers an AI Colour Enhancement feature for camera.The OnePlus Nord CE 2 features a triple rear camera made up of a 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.7 aperture, an 8-megapixel ultra wide camera with 119-degree field of view and f/2.2 aperture, and a 2-megapixel macro camera with f/2.4 aperture.The OnePlus Nord CE meanwhile, has a triple rear camera too.

¬†To give you a gist of the review, overall, the phone is 9.5/10.I'll talk about the specifics in this detailed review which shall give you the complete detailed aspect of the phone.1. DisplayThe display is quite vibrant. Brightness is great even in sunlight. Watching movies on netflix would be fun for you. Refresh rate of 90Hz works as a charm. Overall you won't find any issues with it.2. Processor & RamI have played quite decent games on it. Have run parallel apps at a single time. Couldn't find any lag in with this processor.3. BatteryYour phone charges from 20-100% in just 32 Mins. This 65 W charges is practically a blessing. I have screen time of around 6 hours. The battery lasts 24 hours very easily.4. CameraI don't use much of the camera but it is quite Okayish. Won't say excellent but will do the work.The front camera is quite good.5. Design & BodyThere is a little chin on the bottom of the phone which does not affect much to me but could have been improved. The back silver metallic finish bothers a lot as it shines like a mirror. Also, you will have small dots on the backpanel surface overtime. A cover can be used to minimise this effect. The only reason I reduced 0.5 in my rating is the back panel of the cellphone.6. Operating SystemLoved the operating System, pretty smooth, aesthetically pleasant, charm for your eyes.Overall this phone is a gem. You can always go for it.",Reviewed in India üáÆüá≥ on 16 September 2022

846,5.0,A Pragmatic User's Take,"This is the best smartphone that I have ever owned. If you're someone like me, who wants to jump from the 10k range to a mid-range costing smartphone, I would suggest you go for it. My father and I bought the same phone model on the same day almost three months ago, both of us are not gamers or heavy users, but we prefer the smoothness of everyday workflow over everything else. So if you hate it when your phone takes an extended period of time to open up simple applications, you will love to upgrade to this. I had my apprehensions before buying because of the sceptical comments related to OnePlus dropping its quality, but frankly: I did not see a difference since I have never used a phone beyond the 20-25k price range. Spending more than this amount on a smartphone is just plain splurging in my opinion, especially for middle-class people like us.It does not have any apparent issues, if you take good care of it, I think it should probably last long.All in all, if you're looking for a no non-sense smartphone and think of a phone pragmatically and don't wish to delve into minute details, I would suggest going for this without any second thoughts.",Reviewed in India üáÆüá≥ on 22 September 2022

This is very light and compact phone made by plastic back and frame.Display : 90 Hz is a sweet spot. Feels smooth and good on battery as well.Performance : Processor is doing more than good for day to day tasks. I don't play games so I can't comment on it.Battery : 4500MAH is decent power. It can last a day. 65W charger is amazing charges battery in 35 mins.Os : It's still clean Oxygen os on top of Color os. They should have given Android 12 out of the box.Camera : Missing OIS but not so many phone come in this price range with it. It clicks decent photos and videos in good lighting but struggles a lot in poor light conditions.Cons : I feel they should have provided stereo speakers, iconic alert slider, OIS in main camera and Android 12 out of box.",Reviewed in India üáÆüá≥ on 29 March 2022

The looks are awesome but the plastic back panel disappointing it could be glass. The good thing is you get one plus stickers and a plastic back cover with damage protection (the design of the back cover in a way that it protects your mobile glass from the damage the corners are edgy) so you don't need to buy it with extra cost. Just go for it I bought it for 23999. Very smooth and slick handset. It's not grey...complete mirror but with a black tone. silver you can consider. light weight.",31 May 2022

982,4.0,A good phone to buy,"I have used it for more than a day and based on that, I am writing this review. The phone looks premium. I bought two of them and both the colours (Grey and Blue) are beautiful. It's a lightweight phone that gives a nice feel in hands. Comes with a transparent back cover that fits quite well. Camera quality is good but it should be improved with upcoming updates. I haven't checked 20x zoom yet. User interface is interesting but users like me need some time to become familiar with it. Charger definitely is faster than the supercars. It charges from 10 to 100 percent in 25-30 mins only without heating up. But the problem is the battery life. Without any high uses, it drained so fast. OnePlus must resolve this issue with upcoming updates. I am a moderate gamer and the phone doesn't hang at all, nor I experienced any heating issue. Touch is really smooth and the screen/display colours etc looks really wonderful (I am not a professional so can't write using professional jargons). Fingerprint sensor is fast enough and the animation associated with it looks beautiful. Overall it seems a nice phone to buy.May update the review after using it for a longer period.",3 March 2022

1104,4.0,One Plus is Brand,I am writing this after one complete month of usgae of phone.The phone is a good midranger one if you get it under 20 K using the exchange offer and card one too but not worth it if you get it for 24 K .If you are going to invest 24 K then go for Realme GT Master Edition Or Redmi Note 11 Pro 5g Or Realme 9 Pro 5g Or Iqoo Phones or Samsung M series phones.The Pros AreThe Processor is very good in this range and have multibands 5g.It has a 90 HZ Amoled (Good) Display.The OS is very nice.The Battery üîã stays long and is accomplished by 65 watt charger which makes it much more valuable.It can have memory card as well have two sims which is amazing.ConsThe Camera üì∏ is not up to the mark as one hopes one plus will give.It lacks the the one plus slider.Overall it's a good choice for 20 K.,Reviewed in India üáÆüá≥ on 28 March 2022

To be honest his was a good purchase. Mine didn't turn out as i had expected. Issues that I faced were and some are in ""are"" category1. At times heats up while charging2. Heated up while playing a game especially ""rocket league"". Had to uninstall it3. The pro game mode makes no difference, the frame rate doesn't appear and isn't 60fps (even if i load the 90fps from sys settings)4. At times the finger sensor doesn't show up and i have to do the unlocking using the pin code only.5. Sometimes when I open up a website and zoom in on any picture, then it becomes a task to zoom it out or sometimes even scrolling becomes a big no. And i have to reload the webpage to zoom out from it.6. Oh! Last but not the least, the macro camera is the worst, i love taking macro shots and when I saw its camera well you can guess how mad i would have gotten.Not to leave the pros though1. Battery backup is ok. But not that good, but i can live with that.2. Touch is smooth.3. Display is good, Amoled is fun.",26 December 2022

1155,5.0,Great value phone for the price!,"I made the switch from my Samsung M51 to the Nord CE 2. I did a lot of research before settling on this phone. I read quite a lot of reviews as well. Here's my experience so far:1. I am not a gamer and do not use phones for gaming.2. I am not a photographer and am quite happy with simple photos. I don't care about contrast or saturation.3. I use my phone mainly for banking, messaging, browsing and calls.Switching from the Samsung M51, the Nord CE 2 feels a lot smoother. I can't tell much of a difference in the display between the two. The outdoor brightness for the phone is decent. There is no bloatware installed on the phone which is fantastic (Samsung needs to learn from this!). Sure, there is no Android 12 out of the box but I don't miss it since I've never used it and Android 11 is perfectly fine. The phone will receive the Android 12 update but it might take time (I'm in no hurry). The camera is fine for my needs. It comes with a headphone jack and a charger. Charging is fast -- I went from 50% to 100% in under 25 minutes. I also like that the phone is slightly smaller than the M51 and fits well in my hand and pocket. I've not experienced any overheating issues.Overall, for the price (I got a great deal since I exchanged my phone), it's a great phone. Some people are expecting too much from this phone but if your needs are simple like mine, this is an excellent device.",Reviewed in India üáÆüá≥ on 2 May 2022

That brings the brand No. 2 in sales. But, definitely the brand's overall quality including battery is getting deteriorated since it has been started assembling in Vivo Noida plant.Now abt this product : Plastic type body doesn't give that bad impression, as often critics say. Other established brands in this range n specs r also have plastic body to make product lighter, though it adds to poor heat dissipation problem. U can't feel that unless u have ""never satisfied"" typo critic eyes.Call quality n internet performance is superb matching to processor specs. Can handle group video calls well in even weaker net. Picture quality is awesome with good color n in-depth reproduction. Heavier games make it hotter, but again that's the problem with every phone.

And the bug is so bad, that almost always, the power button has to be pressed for unlocking the phone and at times even then, the fingerprint sensor doesn't give prompt and so the pin has to be entered. Pathetic, I'd say.Worse still is, as understood from the OnePlus community website, the bug is known to the developers, but they've been unable to bring an resolution to this issue till now.",Reviewed in India üáÆüá≥ on 22 April 2022

Absolutely stunning camera, Oxygen OS optimises the apps to perfectly that background apps don't drain your battery. It charges fast and you can just charge it 30mins in the morning before you leave for college or work and it'd be at 100% .

I should have gone for an Oppo newer model as replacement but wanted to try this.15 days after my purchase,  the phone fell down from a high table, maybe about 4-4.5 feet high and the screen broke.Now I have to shell another 8k to get it replaced. While at store, I met three other people who had come for screen replacement too as theirs also broke.  One guy was coming to get it replaced 2nd time.If you do however plan to purchase the phone,  go for a wallet style cover, because I dont think this phone can take any other type of case.My phone was in an open case provided by ONE PLUS and screen was covered with gorilla glass.My oppo falls down on an average 2-3 times a day,  and have had no issues in the past 3 years.... Except for the fact that the memory has become too less for me to accomodate all the apps,  I would have stuck to my oppo.Overall for a brand like ONE PLUS,  I expected better.üòû DISAPPOINTED!!!PROS : The fast charger is really awesome.  30 mins charges it to full.

AMOLED display is amazing. Difference noticed while watching movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix etc. It's super.4. No DTS however phone sound is quite loud. Can take calls on loudspeaker without any issue.5. No complaint in speed. I don't play games however tried and it did not disappoint me.6. No heating issue. Heats little bit while charging and it's obvious as it's 120 W, I believe. Charges mobile to 40% in just 10-15 minutes...7. 2 years warranty. Seems like company is pretty sure, it won't brake down.Conclusion: at this cost getting best OS and happy with that.

1527,3.0,Recommended for Bug n spam free OS experience.,"Actually the rating is three and half stars. Since there's no provision for half star so I've rated it Three! Especially recommended to those who haven't experienced the OnePlus' Oxygen OS so far. For the uninitiated, Oxygen OS provides the bloatware-free OS. Closer to near stock Android.  No spammy notifications like Xiaomi or even Samsung nowadays. Mostly bug-free. The interface is neat.Battery is awesome. Easily lasts whole day with moderate to heavy usage.Camera is just above average.Display is great though it's LCD. Since it's LCD so obviously there's no in-screen fingerprint scanner. It's embedded with physical power button. So people looking for in-screen fingerprint scanner might feel disappointed.Sometimes screen remains dark and unresponsive despite ringing which can be resolved with new S/W patch provided OP deems it worthy to address. Obviously it can't be compared with it's more expensive cousins but overall a nice big phone and the best in this price range. Definitely worth a try, especially if you haven't used Oxygen. For the rest, be adventurous, try something new if you can, otherwise it's always a safe bet.",24 June 2022

1538,5.0,"performance and value under Rs 20,000. But is OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G worth the money","The 6.59-inch LCD display comes with 1080√ó2412 pixels and 401 PPI pixel density. The phone offers a 20:9 aspect ratio and a 120Hz refresh rate. OnePlus has tried to balance it out with support for a 120Hz refresh rate display. But that doesn‚Äôt take the focus away from the display being dull from some of the rivals in the segment. Coming back to the display performance, the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G offers smooth animations, all thanks to the higher refresh rate. Mind you that the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G packs a higher refresh rate than what we get on the OnePlus Nord CE 2, which is a bit costly.We had a good time using the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G display as it supported HD content on popular OTT apps like Netflix and Amazon Prime. The panel is bright and offers swift colours. Though, we have to admit that it missed the punchiness of an AMOLED panel.Overall, it strikes a balance of an inferior panel and a fast refresh rate which should work well for most users in this price segment.",17 May 2022

Yet, it managed to go below those minimum expectations as well. The camera is way below the quality of redmi note 11 (my previous phone) and you can't even install gcam as it's mediatek processor in Nord ce 2.Battery: Charges fast and discharges quickly as well. I can give 3/5 rating as it charges under 30 minutes by compensating the average battery backup.Display: 3/5 ratingIt doesn't seem like a high quality display. I think redmi note 11's (my previous phone) amoled display is better and brighter than this. But, It is an amoled display after all, you can expect good contrast, punchy colours in Nord ce 2 as well.Performance: 4/5 ratingNo lag, No heat, Works very well in day to day tasks.

I'm not much of a phone user, except calls and messaging sometimes. And maybe stream some media and spotify mostly. But on average I register about 3-4 hours of use daily, so the battery life lasts me about a day and a half. Plus this is my first fast charging experience, so I'm happy with that. about 30 mins from 20% to a 100%. Not bad at all. Camera is good too. I won't use it much, but it's a nice feature regardless. everything works quite smooth and overall, a decent phone and quite sturdy too. Build quality is pretty damn good. My only gripe was the delivery. My first order apparently got misplaced by the incompetency of the delivery team. It roamed in my city for 4 days, and after a heated call with customer service, it was replaced with a new order immediately after. So no harm no foul!  Overall I'd give it 4.5 stars.

Pros- Display is good and gets quite bright in outdoors due to its claimed 800 nits brightness.- Supports upto 8 5G bands. Has wifi 6, bluetooth 5.2, nfc, dual 4G sims with expandable storage.- Mediatek dimensity 900 by no means is an efficienct chip and is a power hogger. But it packs a punch for day to day use. No lag and stutters. Snapdragon SOC fans might want to avoid this phone- Calls are clear and loud. Stereo speaker is single and is decent.- Screen refresh rate of 90hz is sufficient and the general use at 90hz feels smooth and fluid.- Under display fingerpriny reader is accurate and never misreads.2. Cons- Camera is decent and requires daylight to take crisp and crystal clear photos.- Battery life is 1 day for heavy users and is 2 days for light users. I got 8hrs of SOT with medium to heavy use.

Only charging while phone switched off will give you proper speed.I have attached one screenshot, see in that screenshot it is showing in notification that charging is complete but in the top battery indicator it is showing 82%. Like this many other bugs are there. Hope OnePlus will eliminate all such bugs in next update as it comes with a old Android version 11 and latest is Android 12.

2241,2.0,Bad product. Has heating issues,"I have ordered this item after doing lot of research for a good phone within my 25k budget. I am not so camera enthusiastic, gaming and chatting person and needed some good phone within my budget meeting my basic expecations like good battery backup, latest Android OS, touch, UI, screen size, weight, call recording options etc..And I have heard lot of good impressions on the OnePlus phones from past.But I am very disappointed by ordering this item as it had some heating issues. The phone heats so fast while charging and using it for continoisly 15-20 mins. I had to return this item after calling customer care and inspecting the phone by installing mInspect app as they found some problem with charging. If you are fine with heating issues then go ahead buying this product .As I am not so camera enthusiastic person I could not judge much on the camera front. But could take some decent pictures with good image clarity. Also could not check much on the battery as it had heating issues.But touch sensitivity is all good and a good phone which meets your basic expectation within 25k.One plus could have given more focus on resolving the heating issues for this type of flagship phone. And its light weight phone (173 gm) which is easy to carry and handle. Screen size (6.43 inches) is also standard which is enough for viewing videos and chatting. Overall if you are fine with heating issues then its a good option within 25k budget.",Reviewed in India üáÆüá≥ on 28 May 2022

¬†This is the worst experience for me in 30 yrs, i sold out my new mobile in just 18 days & made loss of 12k cz it was not in working condition many times, network issue after ever few hours, every time I had to reboot to work my mobile. No network catching after every few hours & you remain unknown of that..!!!!! So you miss important calls..!!! Every time mobile gets hang & screen automatically gets on & off, no function & unlock w can be done after that.Sound quality was very very bad in speaker & earpiece, also next person was not able to hear clear voice.I was out of station when received mobile online, opened box exactly after return policy day expire, ie. exactly on 7th day of receiving mobile parcel. And so I was not eligible to return or refund it.I will never ever again but or recommend OnePlus in my life .I was their 10 years old customer.They will surely lose Indian market same as Motorola.",14 February 2023

3201,2.0,Not a value for money item,"Was having high expectations while buying. I own a Samsung S20 FE 5G and this OnePlus Nord CE2 was bought as a gift for mom. I should say that I was disappointed. There is a slight lag issue(many already reported, which I ignored while buying).Another thing I noticed is that, the call recording feature is hectic. Like the new phones, it starts the recording after the voice warning. But my S20 FE doesn't warn like this.Another thing is, the auto call recording can be enabled for all non-saved numbers, but for contacts saved in your phone, you would have to manually add them one by one to the list so that auto-recording would happen. That's the most stupid thing. Because most of us would have 1000s of contacts. And adding them one by one to the list for auto-call recording is a tedious task.Another issue is, the camera is way too below average. Expected a better camera from this phone.And I initially noticed some heating issue on the screen side.One advantage is that, the weight is less. So carrying it or using it with your hands won't be a headache.",20 June 2022

Even if we lock the phone while in a call, the display turns on automatically with every small movement and will start dialling on it own which will make the listener uncomfortable (listening to the continuous tap on keys). Other than these two, I have not noticed any other issue. But I feel its not a model worthy of 20K",26 August 2022

4458,1.0,The phone has a software issue with regards to the camera.,"This is my first Oneplus purchase, and I got it for my mother. We have come from using Moto and Lenovo phones, which were decent and got the job done. If not for the damage in one of them, I would have continued with them.I had heard a lot of good this about Oneplus from my friends and family and was excited to get the phone.But on using the phone for a few days, I was left unsatisfied with the cameras. I personally use the Pixel 4a, and despite the pixel having a lesser resolution camera, it outshines the CE2. I was ok with that, because well, pixel is pixel. But, then the most bizarre thing happened. One fine day, the camera app stopped working completely (crashes at launch). Tried all the basic trouble shooting steps recommended by Oneplus, but nothing worked. The flashlight toggle in the notification shade was also greyed out with the message 'camera in use', even after resetting the device completely.At this point, I booked a service request with the care app and sent it for repair. Got the device back in a week, working properly. But to my surprise, after a week of use, the same problem has happened again.I am extremely disappointed and frustrated at this point. This was not expected from Oneplus as a brand. This has left an awfully bad first impression on me and I would not recommend this phone / brand to anyone, based on this experience.",Reviewed in India üáÆüá≥ on 1 August 2022
